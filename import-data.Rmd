## Test Data!!


```{r, message=FALSE}
file_name <- 'https://api.wmata.com/TrainPositions/TrainPositions?contentType={json}' # put url here
  
raw_train_df <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file_name) 
train_df <- raw_train_df$ # figure out what goes here from raw_train_df

train_df_final <- train_df %>% 
    
head(train_df_final)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
