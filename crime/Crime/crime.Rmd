## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(httr)
library(rvest)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)   
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
```

## Importing Data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

crime_all <- read_xlsx("crime-all.xlsx", sheet=1,
                          range = cell_limits(c(4, 1), c(NA, NA)), col_names=TRUE) #%>% 
  #select(`Metropolitan Statistical Area`, `Violent crime`)
crime_A <- crime_all %>% 
  filter(`Counties/principal cities` == "Rate per 100,000 inhabitants") %>% 
  select(`Metropolitan Statistical Area`, `Violent crime`, `Counties/principal cities`)

View(crime_A)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
